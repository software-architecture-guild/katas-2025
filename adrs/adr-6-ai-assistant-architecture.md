# ADR 6: AI Assistant Implementation Using Microkernel Architecture

**Date**: 2025-02-15

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As the AI Assistant is introduced into the certification system, it must be designed for flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with existing components. The **Microkernel architecture** (also known as the plug-in architecture) is well suited for this purpose as it enables modularity, extensibility, and independent deployment of AI-related features without disrupting core system functionality.

Given the evolving nature of AI technologies, a **Microkernel-based approach** allows us to integrate multiple AI models and services while maintaining system stability. This ensures that AI components can be updated, replaced, or extended without requiring major system overhauls.

## Decision

We have decided to target the following architectural characteristics:

* **Cost**: Lowering costs is a primary factor for introducing the AI Assistant. The cost should be lower than the current manual grading approach.
* **Evolvability**: AI is continuously evolving, and the architecture must support easy integration of new components or replacement of existing ones.
* **Simplicity**: AI systems are inherently complex, so our architecture should not introduce unnecessary additional complexity.

Based on our targeted architectural characteristics, the **Microkernel architecture** was chosen:

* **Cost**: The Microkernel architecture enables modular AI components, reducing overall system complexity and minimizing operational costs.
* **Evolvability**: The plug-in architecture supports easy integration of new AI models or the replacement of existing ones as AI technologies evolve.
* **Simplicity**: The Microkernel approach maintains a clear separation between the core system and AI extensions, ensuring that complexity remains manageable.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Facilitates continuous improvement and iteration of AI-based functionalities.
* Enhances maintainability by isolating AI logic from the core certification platform.
* Allows multiple AI models to be tested and deployed in parallel.
* Reduces risk by enabling easy rollback or replacement of AI plug-ins if needed.
* Supports the integration of third-party AI services without major architectural changes.

### Negative

* Initial implementation complexity due to the need for a structured plug-in framework.
* Additional effort required to manage the lifecycle and interoperability of AI modules.
* Potential overhead in coordinating communication between AI plug-ins and the core system.

### Risks

* Poorly designed AI plug-ins could introduce inefficiencies or inconsistencies in the certification process.
* Lack of governance over plug-in updates could lead to uncontrolled system behavior.
* Interoperability challenges may arise if AI plug-ins require differing data formats or communication protocols.

By adopting a **Microkernel architecture**, we ensure that the AI Assistant remains adaptable, scalable, and maintainable, aligning with long-term business and technical goals while minimizing risks associated with AI deployment.
