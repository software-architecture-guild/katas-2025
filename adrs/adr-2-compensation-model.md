# ADR 2: Current Expert Compensation Model Discourages Efficiency

**Date**: 2025-02-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The current expert compensation model is based on hourly payments, which does not incentivize efficiency. Experts are paid for the time spent on grading aptitude tests and architecture submissions rather than the number of evaluations completed. As a result, there is no financial motivation for experts to improve their grading speed or leverage AI-assisted tools to enhance productivity.

Given the anticipated 5-10X increase in certification requests, this inefficiency will become a significant bottleneck. Maintaining the current model will result in increased operational costs, delays in certification processing, and a heavier workload on experts, ultimately affecting scalability and business viability.

## Decision

To encourage efficiency and align expert compensation with performance, the following changes are proposed:

* **Transition from an hourly compensation model to a per-evaluation payment structure**, ensuring experts are rewarded based on completed reviews rather than time spent.
* **Introduce performance-based incentives**, providing bonuses for experts who consistently deliver high-quality, accurate, and timely evaluations.
* **Encourage AI-assisted grading**, allowing experts to use automated tools to accelerate their work while maintaining oversight and accuracy.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Encourages experts to work more efficiently, reducing grading time while maintaining accuracy.
* Enables the system to handle increased certification volume without requiring a proportional increase in expert headcount.
* Lowers operational costs by reducing the time-based expenses associated with manual grading.
* Enhances expert motivation and engagement by aligning compensation with output rather than time spent.
* Increases the adoption of AI-assisted tools, improving overall grading consistency and accuracy.

### Negative

* Experts may initially resist the change due to concerns about income stability.
* Rapid transitions may create temporary inconsistencies in grading speed and quality.
* The new compensation model may require additional monitoring and administration to ensure fairness.

### Risks

* If not properly structured, the per-evaluation model could incentivize rushed and lower-quality grading.
* Experts who rely on hourly wages may find the transition challenging, requiring a phased implementation approach.
* AI-assisted tools may require additional training and oversight to prevent over-reliance and potential grading inaccuracies.

Implementing this new compensation model will significantly improve efficiency, scalability, and sustainability while ensuring grading remains accurate and fair.
