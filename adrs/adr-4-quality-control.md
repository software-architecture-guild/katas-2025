# ADR 4: Implementing a Quality Control Process Before System Improvements

**Date**: 2025-02-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Ensuring accuracy and reliability in expert grading and certification processes is critical. Currently, there are no formalized mechanisms to measure expert grading accuracy, track inconsistencies, or identify performance variations among experts. Without a structured quality control process, grading inconsistencies, biases, or errors can be introduced when implementing system improvements.

A quality control framework is essential to establish baseline performance metrics, track expert grading accuracy over time, and assess the effectiveness of experts' evaluations before making system-wide changes. This process must be implemented before improvements to ensure changes lead to measurable benefits.

## Decision

To maintain high standards of accuracy and reliability, the following quality control measures will be implemented:

* **Anomaly Detection Process**: Validate grades against similar past submissions to identify and correct deviations, ensuring consistency in grading standards.
* **Introduce Appeal Process**: Implement a structured process allowing candidates to formally contest grades, capturing potential false negative errors and ensuring fairness.
* **Baseline Performance Metrics**: Establish a benchmark for current expert grading accuracy and consistency to compare against future performance.
* **Quality Audits**: Regular reviews of expert grading accuracy to identify inconsistencies, ensure adherence to defined evaluation criteria, and identify those needing additional training or recalibration.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Provides measurable data to evaluate whether system changes result in actual improvements.
* Reduces the risk of grading inconsistencies and unfair assessments.
* Ensures fairness and consistency in grading, increasing trust among candidates and stakeholders.
* Enables continuous improvement through iterative tracking and refinement of expert grading processes.

### Negative

* Additional operational overhead may be introduced due to ongoing quality audits and reviews.
* Potential resistance from experts who may view performance tracking as intrusive or unnecessary.
* Possible delays in implementing changes while expert performance is assessed and optimized.

### Risks

* Quality control measures may become bureaucratic and slow down necessary system updates if not implemented effectively.
* Poorly defined benchmarks or evaluation criteria could lead to incorrect assessments of expert performance.
* Lack of engagement from key stakeholders could undermine the effectiveness of the quality control process.

By establishing a rigorous quality control process, we ensure that all future system enhancements are backed by empirical data, improve expert grading accuracy, and uphold the credibility of our certification program.
