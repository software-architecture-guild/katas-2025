# ADR 1:  AI/ML Development Principles

**Date**: 2025-02-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

When transitioning from controlled environments to real-world applications, AI and ML solutions are inherently complex and unpredictable. No single model or approach can be assumed to be the most effective or reliable without rigorous, comparative evaluation under real-world conditions.

Multiple candidate solutions should be developed and tested in parallel rather than relying on a single AI/ML solution. The objective is to iteratively compare their performance based on real-world feedback and select the best-performing model for production use. This ensures robustness, adaptability, and continuous improvement as data and user interactions evolve.

## Decision

AI/ML development within our architecture must adhere to the following principles:

* **Multiple AI/ML solutions must be developed in parallel** rather than assuming a single model will be optimal.
* **Real-world testing must validate reliability**, using empirical performance data to select the most effective solution.
* **Iterative evaluation and refinement must continuously** ensure that models evolve based on actual usage conditions.
* **Decisions on model selection should be data-driven**, prioritizing solutions that demonstrate superior real-world effectiveness.
* **Fallback mechanisms should be in place**, allowing for seamless transitions if a model underperforms or becomes unreliable over time.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Ensures AI/ML models are chosen based on real-world effectiveness rather than theoretical assumptions.
* Reduces reliance on a single solution, mitigating risks associated with unexpected failures or biases.
* Encourages innovation and adaptability by allowing multiple approaches to compete for production deployment.
* Provides resilience by maintaining alternative models that can be quickly adopted if primary solutions degrade.
* Strengthens confidence in AI-driven decisions by proving model reliability through empirical evidence.

### Negative

* Developing and maintaining multiple solutions increases initial development and operational costs.
* Parallel testing requires additional infrastructure for monitoring and evaluating multiple models simultaneously.
* Decision-making complexity increases as teams must balance trade-offs between multiple competing solutions.

### Risks

* Poorly managed multi-solution testing could lead to decision paralysis or excessive delays in deployment.
* The high costs of running multiple models may outweigh performance gains if not correctly optimized.
* Without strong governance, the iterative approach may lead to uncontrolled experimentation, impacting stability and reliability.

Embedding these principles into our AI/ML development lifecycle ensures we make data-driven, real-world-validated decisions while maintaining adaptability and resilience against unforeseen challenges.
