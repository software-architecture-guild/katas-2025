## Welcome

Welcome to the [Software Architecture Guild](https://software-architecture-guild.com/) Architectural Kata run by O'Reilly in February 2025.

We are the Software Architecture Guild — a group of seasoned software architects who have spent years working together, honing our craft, and developing a shared approach to software architecture. During this time, we leveled up our skills and learned invaluable lessons about what it takes to succeed in this field.

Our mission is to design and shape the foundation upon which software architectures evolve, AI-driven insights emerge, and intelligent solutions are built.

As architects, we understand the power and potential of AI to transform industries, drive efficiencies, and unlock new possibilities. We are at the forefront of designing, securing, and optimizing software ecosystems to fully leverage AI capabilities and create adaptive, scalable, and intelligent systems.

In our work we mainly utilize following techniques:

## Business Case

### Background

Certifiable, Inc. is a recognized leader in software architecture certification, providing accredited certification to software architects primarily in the U.S. Due to recent regulatory changes, international markets including the U.K., Europe, and Asia now require software architects to be certified, significantly increasing the demand for certification services. With this anticipated expansion, Certifiable, Inc. is facing a substantial surge in certification requests—estimated to grow 5-10 times their current volume. The existing manual processes for test grading and certification management are proving to be inefficient and unsustainable at this scale.

Given this challenge, the company is exploring how Generative AI can be integrated into their current system to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and maintain high certification standards while managing cost constraints.

### Market Opportunity

The global demand for certified software architects is accelerating due to government regulations and industry requirements.

- **Market Size & Growth**: The U.S. alone has over 176,000 software architects, with 300,000 job openings. Internationally, the number of software architects is estimated to be around 600,000, and the industry is projected to grow by 21% over the next four years.
- **Revenue Potential**: Certifiable, Inc. currently processes 200 candidates per week at a fixed certification cost of $800. With the expected increase in demand, this number could rise to 1,000-2,000 candidates weekly, translating into an annual revenue increase from certification fees alone.
- **Competitive Advantage**: As the market leader, Certifiable, Inc. holds over 80% market acceptance in the U.S. and a dominant presence in international markets. Successfully implementing AI-driven automation will strengthen its position as the most efficient and reliable certification provider globally.

### Objective

The primary objective is to modernize the SoftArchCert system by leveraging Generative AI to streamline the certification process while maintaining accuracy, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

#### Key Goals

- **Enhance Efficiency**: Reduce manual workload by automating grading processes, candidate feedback, and test modifications.
- **Maintain Accuracy & Quality**: Ensure AI-driven grading maintains the high standards required for certification validity.
- **Scale Operations**: Support a five to tenfold increase in certification candidates without overwhelming human graders.
- **Cost Optimization**: Implement AI solutions that align with budget constraints while providing maximum efficiency.

### Stakeholders

Several key stakeholders will be impacted by this initiative:

#### Internal Stakeholders

- **Certifiable, Inc. Leadership**: Executive management responsible for strategic direction and investment in AI-driven improvements.
- **Software Architect Graders**: Expert software architects who grade aptitude tests and case studies; their workload and processes will be affected by AI-driven automation.
- **System Administrators**: Responsible for maintaining certification systems and implementing AI-enhanced features.
- **Technology Team**: Architects and developers responsible for integrating AI into the SoftArchCert system.

### **External Stakeholders**

- **Certification Candidates**: Software architects seeking certification who will experience a potentially faster, AI-enhanced grading process.
- **Accreditation Bodies (SALB & International Licensing Boards)**: Organizations responsible for maintaining certification integrity and compliance.
- **Employers & Hiring Managers**: Companies that rely on Certifiable, Inc. certifications for hiring and verifying software architects.

By addressing these stakeholder needs and aligning with market opportunities, Certifiable, Inc. can ensure its continued dominance in the certification industry while meeting the demands of an expanding global market.
